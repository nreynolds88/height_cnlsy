# Assumptions and Limits

## Pending Decisions
- Final variable-level wave coverage for each domain.
- Exact weight variable by model family.
- Treatment of imputed values where multiple reporting sources exist.

## Measurement Limits
- Menarche may be contemporaneous or retrospective depending on round and universe.
- Height and weight may vary in source type (measured vs reported) and units.
- Child assessments may have changing availability by age and round.

## Design Assumptions
- Age is computed in months from interview/assessment timing and child DOB components.
- Unit harmonization is performed before measure construction.
- QC assertions stop the pipeline when key assumptions are violated.
